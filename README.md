# SPM-Python Batchmaker

## Overview
This module is designed to provide an interface between python and SPM.
It provides a minimal functionality to set up first-level batches in python that are fully readable by SPM. This is useful, if your local university does not provide sufficient tech support to install neuroimaging data analysis tools native to python, or you want to use SPM anyway for some reason but want to stick with python as much as possible.
